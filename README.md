# Toggle Farm Hud

LUA WoW addon.

[Published on CurseForge |==>](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/toggle-farm-hud)

### `Description`
Auto toggle "Farm Hud" upon login.

If you are using FarmHud instead of the minimap, and you don't want to toggle it ON manually every time you login (although you could, with just one keybind).

(works with all WoW versions, although the toggle delay is set to ten seconds in the Classic version, due to Questie loading time)

### `Dependencies`
Requires "FarmHud" addon.
